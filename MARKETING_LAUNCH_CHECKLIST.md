### Approach Template

```
Hey [Name],

I'm building LUXBIN, the first cryptocurrency backed by real quantum computers (445 qubits on IBM systems).

Would you be interested in covering it? I can offer:
- [X] LUX tokens
- Exclusive early access
- Interview/demo
- Ongoing partnership

Our unique angle: We use quantum measurements for burns, rewards, and lottery. Provably fair through physics.

Interested? Happy to share more details.

Best,
Nichole
```

## Crisis Management

### If Price Dumps

**Response:**
```
We see the price movement. Here's what's happening:

[Explain if you know: whale selling, market-wide dump, etc.]

Remember:
- Quantum burns continue (deflationary)
- Reflections still rewarding holders
- Technology hasn't changed
- Long-term vision intact

We're here for the technology, not day trading.

Not financial advice. DYOR.
```

### If Smart Contract Issue

**Response:**
```
⚠️ ALERT ⚠️

We've identified [issue description].

What we're doing:
1. [Immediate action]
2. [Investigation steps]
3. [Resolution plan]

User funds: [Safe/At risk - be honest]

Updates every [X] hours until resolved.

We take this seriously and will be fully transparent.
```

### If Quantum Computers Go Offline

**Response:**
```
ℹ️ NOTICE ℹ️

[X] quantum computers temporarily offline due to IBM maintenance.

Impact:
- Contract still functional (using fallback randomness)
