Title: LUXBIN: First crypto backed by 445 qubits on 3 IBM quantum computers [AMA]

Body:

Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

I've been working on something unique: a cryptocurrency that uses REAL quantum computers to create value.

**What makes it different:**
- Backed by 445 qubits on 3 IBM quantum computers (not simulated)
- 3% of every transaction is burned using quantum randomness
- 2% auto-distributed to holders (passive income)
- 1% goes to quantum lottery (random winners)
- 2% treasury buyback (automatic buy pressure)

**Why quantum matters:**
Traditional crypto uses pseudo-random numbers (predictable). LUXBIN uses quantum measurements (physically impossible to predict). This means:
- Truly fair lottery (can't be rigged)
- Unpredictable burns (creates excitement)
- Quantum-secure (protected by physics)

**Already deployed:**
- Contract: 0xbB5bf2139CbACDeE52991cf32f9c4d558B9464d0
- Network: Base (Coinbase L2)
- Liquidity: Uniswap
- Quantum feed: Live and running

Ask me anything about quantum computing, the tokenomics, or how it works!
