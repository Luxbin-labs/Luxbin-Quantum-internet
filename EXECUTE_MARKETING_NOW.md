Title: "I built the first cryptocurrency backed by 445 qubits on IBM quantum computers - Now live on Base"

```markdown
Hey r/CryptoCurrency,

I launched LUXBIN yesterday - the first cryptocurrency that uses REAL quantum computers (not simulated) to power its tokenomics.

**What makes it different:**
- 445 qubits from 3 IBM quantum computers (ibm_fez, ibm_torino, ibm_marrakesh)
- Quantum burns, rewards, and lottery (true randomness from physics)
- Gasless transactions via Coinbase Paymaster
- Already 114 holders in 24 hours

**Smart Contracts on Base:**
- Token: 0xbB5bf2139CbACDeE52991cf32f9c4d558B9464d0
- Quantum Oracle: 0xcA69BB591346a0F6b4F98B4C2aCB650c37D50446
- Lottery: 0x6d14b024122Ec7d03AB9d977686B121A0B0CDF4f
- Staking: 0x4CA7c30e97BDE7A31Ffc963Db61E58460048bEeE

**The Tech:**
Every transaction triggers quantum measurements from real quantum computers. This determines:
- Burns (deflationary)
- Holder rewards (passive income)
- Lottery winners (provably fair)
- Treasury buybacks (unpredictable price pumps)

All entropy is verifiable on-chain through the quantum oracle.

Title: "LUXBIN - 445 Qubits | IBM Quantum | Gasless | 114 Holders | Just Launched"

```markdown
## 🚀 First Quantum-Backed Crypto on Base

**What is it?**
LUXBIN uses 445 qubits from 3 IBM quantum computers for:
- 🔥 Deflationary burns
- 💰 Automatic holder rewards

- 📈 Treasury buybacks

**Why it matters:**
- ✅ Can't be copied (need IBM quantum access)
- ✅ Real utility (quantum randomness as a service)
- ✅ First mover advantage
- ✅ Gasless (Coinbase Paymaster)

This is a significant technological milestone - the first time quantum computers have been integrated into cryptocurrency tokenomics at the protocol level.

Would you be interested in covering this? I'm available for:
- Interview
- Live demo of quantum computers
- Technical deep-dive
- Screenshots/video

Press release attached.

Best regards,
